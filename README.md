# Bug Tracking System

As a part of this TRI-NIT Hackathon, we decided to take up the 2nd dev task, which is to build a robust bug tracking system. 

Our bug tracking system is comprised of 2 major parts: The bugs themselves, and the teams. We aim to cater the actual professional developers through this project, for example an enterprise could use this project to its fullest potential, that is why we decided to focus more on the teams aspect of this system.

Basically, if a bug has to be reported, the user should either be in a team, or a new team will be created for the bug to be handled.


## Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenzeneAlcohol/TRINIT_SCRIPTKIDDIES_DEV.git
```
cd into the folder and install all the dependences

```bash
cd TRINIT_SCRIPTKIDDIES_DEV
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, cd into the source folder and run app.js

If you are running mongoDB locally, make sure to run "mongod" command in your terminal before you proceed.
